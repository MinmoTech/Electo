= Electo music player

[NOTE]
====
This is a very ambitious project. It is currently just a draft of ideas which will hopefully incrementally come to reality. Some of these ideas might not be possible.

== Goals
* Target multiple streaming platforms as music sources
* Cross platform: target Android, iOS, Linux, Windows and Mac (priority targets are Android and Linux)
* This should probably be doable with React Native - see Plexamp
* Multi-streaming-platform playlists (name suggestion: aggregations)
* Music video finding - via search or community databases (e.g. https://vocadb.net/)
* Download aggregations by default to prevent missing songs on video deletion
* Service migration - in case a song gets deleted on one service, you can migrate it
* Database of aggregations can be exported as a text file to sync between devices, additionally a paid backend service using cloud object storage?
* Song discovery is a low priority, maybe only within each individual service initially
